In this project, you can make SpongeBob and his friend Patrick to take a walk by the Jellyfish Field.

If you press the Arrow Keys, Bob will move.
If you press W, A, S, D, Patrick will move.

If you press Up/Down and Left/Right (or Patrick's correspondent keys) at the same time, the characters will go diagonally.

If any character reaches the end of the field, or if they meet another character, they stop walking.

This is a abandoned project. I will not be updating it anymore.
I noticed that, unless the computer running the code is very powerful and fast, it starts to lag terribly.
Apparently, that's the reason why canvas tag exists. To move an actual div is not the best way of doing it. The right way would be draw things on the canvas.
So I'm learning how to handle the canvas, and then I will redo this project using it.
