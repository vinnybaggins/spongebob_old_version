# spongebob

In this project, you can make SpongeBob and his friend Patrick to take a walk by the Jellyfish Field.

If you press the Arrow Keys, Bob will move.
If you press W, A, S, D, Patrick will move.

If you press Up/Down and Left/Right (or Patrick's correspondent keys) at the same time, the characters will go diagonally.

If any character reaches the end of the field, or if they meet another character, they stop walking.

I intend to add more features, like making jellyfishs to appear for they to catch. Stay tuned!
